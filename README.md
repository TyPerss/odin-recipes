First assignment in HTML course - recipe site

Ultimately this assignment is to demonstrate capability in using basic HTML skills like:

-Proper semantic use of HTML elements
-Correct usage of ordered and unordered lists
-Linking multiple pages on a site together with anchor elements
-Adding images

Just a start. This'll get bigger when CSS is added later.
