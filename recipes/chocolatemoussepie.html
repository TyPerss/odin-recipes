    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The same time I was craving key lime pie (<a href="./keylimepie.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the recipe I eventually developed can be found here</a>),
         I was also craving something chocolatey. My grandmother has a great chocolate silk pie recipe,
         and I wanted to put it head-to-head with something, so I found a chocolate mousse pie recipe that I modified a bit.
         This recipe is extremely rich, dense, and deliciousâ€”you'll feel like you're eating a decadent cheesecake rather than a simple pie. 
         It's also a breeze to make. If you'd like to see the source recipe, it was taken from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/16956/death-by-chocolate-mousse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Allrecipes recipe</a>.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Around 20 oreos, crushed</li>
          <li>1/4 cup butter, softened</li>
          <li>3 cups heavy cream, divided</li>
          <li>One 12oz package semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
          <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
          <li>A pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 9-inch springform pan with 2 3/4-inch sides.</li>
          <li>Make crust: Mix together crushed cookies and butter in a medium bowl until well combined. Press mixture evenly into the prepared pan.</li>
          <li>Bake crust for 5 minutes (you have some leniency here) then let cool.</li>
          <li>Make filling: Combine 1 cup cream, chocolate chips, vanilla, and salt in the top of a double boiler. Heat, stirring occasionally,
              until chocolate is fully melted and mixture is smooth. Pour chocolate mixture into a large bowl; cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally.</li>
          <li>Beat 2 cups cream in a second large bowl until stiff peaks form. Fold into chocolate mixture until well combined. Pour mixture into cooled crust.
              Chill pie in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours before topping and serving.</li>
          <li>(Optional) Make whipped topping from additional cream and either confectioner's or granulated sugar and pipe or cover pie in topping.</li>
        </ol>
