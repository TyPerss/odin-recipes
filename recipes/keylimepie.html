    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>I was craving key lime pie one day and found a great recipe online for key lime pie without key limes.
         That seemed like a fun idea, but I also had a roommate at the time whose mother had a great key lime recipe we had all enjoyed before.
         I decided to make both of the pies, compare them, modify both recipes and try them again, and keep on experimenting with them until I was happy.
         I'm finally happy. This recipe is a combination of the two recipes and is my favorite variation that came from this whole experiment.
         If you'd like to see the source recipes, the majority was taken from <a href="https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/key-lime-pie.html#tabrecipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Once Upon a Chef recipe</a>,
         with some modifications inspired by <a href="https://soufflebombay.com/prize-winning-key-lime-pie-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Souffle Bombay recipe</a>.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>2 cups crushed graham cracker crumbs</li>
          <li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
          <li>6 TBSP butter, melted</li>
          <li>Two 14-oz cans sweetened condensed milk</li>
          <li>1 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
          <li>1 TBSP lime zest</li>
          <li>1/2 cup fresh lime juice</li>
          <li>1/4 cup key lime juice</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 375.</li>
          <li>Combine graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and brown sugar. Press into a 9-inch deep dish pie pan.</li>
          <li>Bake for 10 minutes (you have a lot of leniency with the timing) then let cool.</li>
          <li>Lower oven temperature to 350.</li>
          <li>Whisk together both lime juices, lime zest, and yogurt. Add sweetened condensed milk and combine thoroughly.</li>
          <li>Pour the mixture into the warm graham cracker crust, then bake for 15 minutes. The filling will be just a little wobbly.</li>
          <li>Let the pie cool at room temperature until it's cool enough to touch, then cool in refrigerator for a few hours before serving
              (you can serve sooner, but this gives the pie time to settle into the flavor).</li>
        </ol>
